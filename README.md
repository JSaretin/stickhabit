# StickHabit

We always focus on getting things done. The truth is that, sometimes, it's the little actions that we did to get the thing done that build and shape our lives.

Like GitHub for example, you will receive the little green square for pushing changes to the platform. That means, you don't get rewarded for just looking at the platform or for contributing code to an open source project offline. In reality, it's small habit like these that compound into receiving the ultimate green square. But what if you don't know anything about GitHub and you want to learn to contribute to projects too. This means you won't get rewarded for the effort of learning to use the platform.

What StickHabit allows you to do is define all these small habit that you'd like to reward yourself for and go ahead to reward yourself after completing these tasks. In the example of learning to use the GitHub platform, I can create a new habit of "Spend 10 minutes learning how to use GitHub and version control" this will allow me to check the habit off for the day if I spent 10 minutes learning how to use version control or learn something new about the GitHub platform. All these small habit will then accumulate to "Contribute to a project on GitHub and push the changes" habit later on. Without the first phase of the habit building, then the last part will not be complete and without encouragement and reward for cultivating the first phase, the last phase will not be possible as well.
